# ðŸš€ Autofy Workflow Bot - Integration Complete!

Great news! I've successfully integrated the Autofy Workflow Bot into your existing website. Here's what's been added and how to access it:

## âœ… What's Been Integrated

### 1. **New Route Added**: `/bot`
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/bot` (or your domain + `/bot`)
- The bot is now accessible through your existing sidebar navigation
- Added "AI Bot" menu item with a Bot icon

### 2. **Components Added**:
- `src/components/WorkflowBotChat.tsx` - Main chat interface
- `src/pages/WorkflowBotDemo.tsx` - Full page with stats and chat
- `src/utils/secretsHandler.ts` - Security utilities
- `src/types/workflowBot.ts` - TypeScript definitions

### 3. **Backend Components**:
- `supabase/functions/chat-bot/index.ts` - AI conversation handler
- `supabase/functions/create-zap/index.ts` - Workflow creation
- Database migrations for chat storage

### 4. **Styled to Match Your App**:
- Dark theme consistent with your existing design
- Same gradient colors (blue to violet)
- Integrated with your existing auth system
- Uses your existing Sidebar component

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Access

1. **Start your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the bot**:
   - Go to your app (usually `http://localhost:3000`)
   - Sign in if you haven't already
   - Click "AI Bot" in the sidebar navigation
   - Or directly visit: `http://localhost:3000/bot`

## ðŸ”§ Setup Requirements

Before the bot will work, you need to complete these steps:

### 1. Database Setup
Run these SQL commands in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- First, run this migration:
-- Copy and paste the content from: supabase/migrations/20240102000001_create_chat_schema.sql

-- Then run this migration:
-- Copy and paste the content from: supabase/migrations/20240102000002_create_match_messages_function.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Add to your Supabase project environment settings:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

Your existing variables should already work:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### 3. Deploy Edge Functions
```bash
supabase functions deploy chat-bot
supabase functions deploy create-zap
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Try It Out!

Once set up, you can test the bot with phrases like:

- **"Create a zap to save important emails to Notion"**
- **"I want Telegram notifications for urgent emails"**
- **"Help me set up an AI email summarizer"**
- **"Create a workflow that processes emails with AI"**

## ðŸ”’ Security Features

The bot automatically:
- Detects API keys and replaces them with `{{secrets.KEY}}` format
- Validates all JSON against your zap schema
- Creates zaps as inactive for safety
- Stores conversations securely with user isolation

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Features

- **Real-time validation** with green/red indicators
- **Copy to clipboard** for generated JSON
- **Download JSON** functionality
- **One-click zap creation** directly to your dashboard
- **Conversation memory** using AI embeddings

## ðŸ“± Mobile Friendly

The interface is responsive and works great on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **"Please sign in to use the workflow bot"**
   - Make sure you're authenticated in your app
   - Check that your auth context is working

2. **"HTTP error! status: 404"**
   - Edge functions may not be deployed yet
   - Run `supabase functions deploy chat-bot` and `supabase functions deploy create-zap`

3. **"Missing or invalid authorization header"**
   - Database migrations may not be complete
   - Check Supabase SQL editor for any errors

4. **Empty responses or errors**
   - Verify GEMINI_API_KEY is set in Supabase environment
   - Check Supabase function logs for detailed errors

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Complete the setup steps above** (database + environment + functions)
2. **Test the bot** with simple requests
3. **Try creating a real workflow** and verify it appears in your dashboard
4. **Explore advanced features** like multi-step workflows with AI
