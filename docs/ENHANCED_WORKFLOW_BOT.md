# Enhanced Autofy Workflow Bot 🤖

The Enhanced Autofy Workflow Bot is an intelligent assistant that helps users create valid Autofy JSON workflows (zaps) through natural conversation. The bot has been significantly improved to be smarter, ask fewer questions, and create zaps more efficiently.

## Key Improvements ✨

### 🧠 Smart System Prompt
- Bot now queries user's connected integrations and available data
- Knows which services are already connected (Gmail, Telegram, Notion, OpenRouter)
- Understands user's active Telegram chats and their details
- Provides context-aware responses based on user's setup

### 🔐 Intelligent Credential Handling
- **NEVER asks for API keys, tokens, or passwords**
- Automatically uses `{{integration.service_name}}` format for all credentials
- Validates that credentials use proper integration references
- Prevents credential exposure in zap configurations

### 📱 Auto-populated Data
- **Telegram**: Automatically detects user's connected chats - no need to ask for chat_id
- **Gmail**: Only asks for functional filters (keywords, sender) not credentials
- **Notion**: Only asks for database_id with helpful guidance
- **OpenRouter**: Asks for model and prompt preferences only

### ✅ Flexible Validation
- Only validates **functional parameters** that affect zap behavior
- Ignores credential fields when they use integration references
- Allows Gmail triggers without specific filters (processes all emails)
- Allows Telegram actions without explicit chat_id (sends to all user chats)

### 🛠️ Enhanced Defaults
- Applies sensible defaults for optional parameters
- Telegram: `parse_mode: "HTML"`, `disable_web_page_preview: "true"`
- OpenRouter: `temperature: 0.7`, `max_tokens: 1000`
- Gmail: `is_html: "false"` for plain text emails

## How It Works 🔄

### 1. User Intent Recognition
```
User: "Create a zap to send telegram notifications for important emails"
```

### 2. Smart Data Checking
- ✅ Checks: User has Gmail connected
- ✅ Checks: User has Telegram connected  
- ✅ Checks: User has active Telegram chats
- ✅ Result: Ready to create zap with minimal questions

### 3. Intelligent Questioning
```
Bot: "I can create that for you! I see you have Gmail and Telegram connected with active chats.
     
     What keywords should I use to filter important emails? 
     (e.g., 'urgent, important, deadline')"
```

### 4. Smart Zap Generation
```json
{
  "name": "Important Email Alerts",
  "description": "Auto-generated Zap from gmail to telegram",
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_type": "trigger",
      "service_name": "gmail", 
      "event_type": "new_email",
      "configuration": {
        "keywords": "urgent, important, deadline",
        "client_id": "{{integration.gmail}}",
        "client_secret": "{{integration.gmail}}",
        "refresh_token": "{{integration.gmail}}"
      }
    },
    {
      "step_type": "action",
      "service_name": "telegram",
      "event_type": "send_message", 
      "configuration": {
        "message_template": "🚨 Important Email\\n\\n📧 From: {{sender}}\\n📌 Subject: {{subject}}",
        "bot_token": "{{integration.telegram}}",
        "parse_mode": "HTML",
        "disable_web_page_preview": "true"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Validation & Creation
- ✅ Validates functional parameters only
- ✅ Accepts integration references for credentials
- ✅ Creates zap successfully in dashboard
- ✅ Sets as inactive for safety (user activates when ready)

## What the Bot No Longer Asks ❌

### Before (Problematic Behavior)
- ❌ "What's your Gmail API key?"
- ❌ "Please provide your Telegram bot token"
- ❌ "What's your Telegram chat_id?"
- ❌ "Enter your Notion integration token"
- ❌ Multiple credential-related questions

### After (Smart Behavior)  
- ✅ Only asks for email filter keywords
- ✅ Only asks for Notion database ID (with guidance)
- ✅ Only asks for AI model preferences
- ✅ Uses connected services automatically

## Supported Workflows 🚀

### 📧 Gmail-Based Workflows
1. **Email → Telegram Notifications**
   - Trigger: New Gmail emails with keywords
   - Action: Send Telegram message to user's chats
   - Asks for: Email keywords only

2. **Email → Notion Backup**
   - Trigger: New Gmail emails
   - Action: Create Notion page
   - Asks for: Keywords + Notion database ID

3. **AI Email Auto-Reply**

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: For AI processing
- Standard Supabase variables

### 3. Test the Bot
1. Connect integrations (Gmail, Telegram, etc.)
2. Navigate to `/bot` in your app
3. Ask: "Create a zap for important email alerts"
4. Observe the improved, smarter behavior

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Common Issues

#### Bot Still Asks for Credentials
- Check that `enrichZapWithUserData()` is being called
- Verify integration references are properly applied
- Ensure user has connected the required services

#### Telegram chat_id Still Required
- Check that user has active Telegram chats in database
- Verify `telegram_chats` table has data for the user
- Ensure bot system prompt includes chat information

#### Validation Fails
- Check that functional parameters are provided
- Verify JSON structure follows Autofy format
- Ensure integration references use correct format

### Debug Steps
1. Check Supabase function logs for errors
2. Verify user's connected integrations in database
3. Test with sample zap JSON from `test-smart-zap.json`
4. Review chat session history for context
